In this project, I analyze DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) time series data.

The repository contains the following files:

1. A jupyter notebook file with the analysis of the fluorescence intensity data changing in the course of a PCR.

2. A python script that generates a data frame from all the data in the directory corresponding to one particular experiment and generates fluorescence time series plots.
